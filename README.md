Zombie Rush
=================================

This is a flappy bird clone built in Unity. 

This project expands upon my previous game. It has better use of textures, sound effect and music and scripts applied to objects.

The obstacles move up and down and the user has to navigate around them.

I also added a UI system, which includes a start screen and a game over screen.


Here is a video of the game in action.
